# Vocal-Music-Remover-ML
This project helps to seperate music and vocals.

Origin idea was to help travellers to remove music from background while they're creating their content thus removing the risk of de-monetization from YouTube.

Fortunately YouTube is giving you options when there's copyrighted music in your video.

# Moral of story:
# Talk to customers before building.
